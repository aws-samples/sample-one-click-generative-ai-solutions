!!! warning "Security Considerations"
    For production use, the following security measures are recommended:

    1. **IP Restrictions**: Use `AllowedIpV4AddressRanges` and `AllowedIpV6AddressRanges` to restrict access to specific IP addresses
    2. **Disable Self-Signup**: Set `SelfSignUp` to `false` and have administrators create users
    3. **Email Domain Restrictions**: Use `AllowedSignUpEmailDomains` to allow signups only from specific domains

### Post-Deployment Setup

After clicking the deployment button, you will receive an email titled `AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation` after a short while. Click the `Confirm subscription` link to start receiving deployment start and completion notifications.

When deployment is complete, you'll receive a notification email containing:

1. Frontend URL
2. Instructions for setting up Amazon Bedrock model access
3. User creation instructions (if self-signup is disabled)
4. How to add users to special groups:
    - `CreatingBotAllowed`: Permission to create custom bots
    - `Admin`: Administrator permissions
    - `PublishAllowed`: Permission to publish APIs

### Resource Removal

To remove deployed resources, delete the `BedrockClaudeChat` and `BrChatDeploymentStack` stacks from the CloudFormation console.
