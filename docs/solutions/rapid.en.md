# Review & Assessment Powered by Intelligent Documentation (RAPID)

[RAPID](https://github.com/aws-samples/review-and-assessment-powered-by-intelligent-documentation) is a document review solution powered by generative AI (Amazon Bedrock). It streamlines review processes involving extensive documents and complex checklists using a Human in the Loop approach. It supports the entire process from checklist structuring to AI-assisted review and final human judgment, reducing review time and improving quality.

## Key Features

- **Checklist Structuring**: Automatically structures complex checklists into AI-understandable formats
- **AI-Powered Document Review**: Leverages Amazon Bedrock to automatically analyze and evaluate document content
- **Human in the Loop**: Framework for humans to review and modify AI judgment results
- **Review Result Visualization**: Displays review results in an easy-to-understand format to support efficient verification work
- **Batch Processing Support**: Capable of processing large volumes of documents in batches
- **Customizable**: Checklists can be customized according to industry and use case requirements

## Key Use Cases

* **Product Specification Compliance Review**
   * Efficiently verify that product development specifications meet requirements and industry standards. Automate the process of comparing thousands of specifications annually against hundreds of checkpoints. AI extracts and structures relevant information from specifications, visualizing compliance results. Reviewers can efficiently perform final verification.
* **Technical Manual Quality Verification**
   * Verify that complex technical manuals comply with internal guidelines and industry standards. Support the process of comparing tens of thousands of pages of technical documentation annually against thousands of quality criteria. Automatically detect missing technical information and inconsistencies, supporting the creation of consistent, high-quality manuals.
* **Procurement Document Compliance Verification**
   * Check that procurement documents and proposals meet necessary requirements. Automatically extract required information from documents spanning hundreds of pages, streamlining thousands of document reviews annually. Improve procurement process speed and accuracy by having humans verify compliance results against requirement lists.

!!! warning "Security Considerations"
    For production use, the following security measures are recommended:

    1. **IP Restrictions**: Use `AllowedIpV4AddressRanges` and `AllowedIpV6AddressRanges` to restrict access to specific IP addresses
    2. **Disable Self-Signup**: Set `CognitoSelfSignUpEnabled` to `false` and have administrators create users
    3. **Proper Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls when handling sensitive documents

### Post-Deployment Setup

After clicking the deployment button, you will receive an email titled `AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation`. Click the `Confirm subscription` link to start receiving deployment start and completion notifications.

When deployment is complete, you'll receive a notification email containing:

1. **Frontend URL**: URL to access the application
2. **API URL**: API endpoint URL
3. **Amazon Bedrock Model Access Setup**: Instructions for enabling access to required models
   - Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - Amazon Nova Premier
4. **User Creation Instructions**: How to create users when self-signup is disabled
5. **Configuration Information**: Confirmation of parameters specified during deployment

### Resource Removal
