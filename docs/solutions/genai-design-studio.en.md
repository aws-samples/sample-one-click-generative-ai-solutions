### Parameter Configuration

You can configure the following parameters during deployment:

* **NotificationEmailAddress**: Email address to receive deployment start/completion notifications
* **SelfSignUp** (default: true): Enable/disable self-signup functionality
* **AllowedSignUpEmailDomains**: Allowed email domains for signup without the "@" symbol (comma-separated, e.g., example.co.jp)
* **AllowedIpV4AddressRanges** (default: 0.0.0.0/1,128.0.0.0/1): Allowed IPv4 address ranges for access
* **AllowedIpV6AddressRanges** (default: 0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/1,8000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/1): Allowed IPv6 address ranges for access

!!! warning "Security Considerations"
    For production use, we recommend the following security measures:

    1. **IP Restrictions**: Use `AllowedIpV4AddressRanges` and `AllowedIpV6AddressRanges` to restrict accessible IP addresses
    2. **Email Domain Restrictions**: Use `AllowedSignUpEmailDomains` to allow signup only from specific domains
    3. **Self-Signup Management**: Set `SelfSignUp` to `false` if needed and have administrators create users

    If IP restrictions are not configured, the application will be deployed with public access. When `SelfSignUp` is set to false, user creation through AWS account (Amazon Cognito) is required.

### Post-Deployment Setup

After clicking the deploy button, you will receive an `AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation` email after a short while. Click the `Confirm subscription` link to receive deployment start and completion notifications.

Once deployment is complete, you will receive a notification email containing:

1. Application URL
2. Amazon Bedrock model access setup instructions

### Resource Cleanup

To delete deployed resources, remove the following stacks from the CloudFormation console:

1. `VtoAppStack` stack (main application)
2. `GenStudioDeploymentStack` stack (deployment stack)
