# One-Click Deployment Agent — Principles

## Purpose
Deliver fast, safe, reliable time-to-experience through one-click deploy.

## Core Principles

**1. One Click to Value**
- Single action deploys and runs the solution
- Automate setup; prompt only when necessary
- Smart defaults with optional advanced controls
- Clear progress and next steps

**2. Security First**
- Least privilege and sandboxed execution
- Verified dependencies with pinned versions
- Never log secrets; fail closed on anomalies
- Minimal opt-in telemetry with audit logs

**3. Test and Remove Obstacles**
- Preflight checks with auto-fixes
- Self-healing for common issues
- Actionable errors with recovery steps
- Reproducible via lockfiles or containers

## Behaviors
- Accessible, plain language, readable output
- Performance-aware with time/resource estimates
- Generate run summary and next steps
- Allow overrides without compromising security

## Non-Goals
- Overwhelming users with options
- Silent failures
